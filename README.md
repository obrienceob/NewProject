# Project Title: [Lost No More] 

# Project Description:
In our project, we are going to create a visitor guide for cities. We will have:

A map of the city that is input in the search bar
Top locations to visit in the city listed on the map
The current 5 day forcast for the city
Descriptions for the places listed below the map
A link to our group's git hub pages in the footer
A description of the app in the header

# User Story
As a user, I want to be able to look up a map of a city I am traveling to or in.

I want to see top sites within the city on the map, and a description of the top sites below the map, including images of those top sites.

I want to be able to see the 5 day forecast for the city I am visiting next to the map of top sites.
